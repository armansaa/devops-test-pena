DevOps Technical Test – Hybrid Deployment
Scenario
You will deploy one application (an application you own) in two different ways::
1. As a traditional service using PM2 on VM (via Ansible)
2. As a containerized service using Docker &amp; Kubernetes (via CI/CD)
This reflects real-world environments where:
● Not all systems run on Kubernetes
● Some workloads still run directly on servers

Use a free-tier platform such as:
● Google Cloud Platform (GKE)
● AWS Free Tier (EKS)
● Azure Free Tier (AKS)
● DigitalOcean Kubernetes Free Trial
● Minikube (local Kubernetes)

PART A – Deploy App via PM2 using
Ansible
A1 – Ansible Setup
Candidate must:
● Setup Ansible project
● Create inventory for:
○ app_servers
● Configure SSH access
Deliverables:

● inventory.ini
● ansible.cfg
● README
A2 – Runtime Setup
Using Ansible:
● Install:
○ Node.js
○ PM2
● Ensure PM2 runs on boot
Deliverables:
● runtime role OR playbook
● Verified after reboot

A3 – App Deployment via PM2
Using Ansible:
● Pull app from Git
● Install dependencies
● Run with PM2
● Expose HTTP port
● Ensure auto-restart
Deliverables:
● app accessible via browser
● no manual ssh deploy

PART B – Docker &amp; CI/CD Deployment
Same app, but containerized.
B1 – Dockerize the App

Candidate must:
● Create Dockerfile
● Build image
● Test locally
Deliverables:
● Dockerfile
● docker run

B2 – CI/CD Pipeline
Design pipeline:
● Git push
● ↓
● Build Docker image
● ↓
● Push to registry
● ↓
● Deploy to Kubernetes
Using:
● GitHub Actions
Deliverables:
● Pipeline YAML
● Explanation

B3 – Kubernetes Deployment
Deploy Dockerized app into Kubernetes:
● Deployment
● Service
● (Optional) Ingress
● (Optional) HPA

Deliverables:
● manifests
● service reachable

PART C – Visibility (Optional)
Add minimal monitoring:
● PM2 logs
● Or Node Exporter
● Or simple Prometheus
This is bonus part
